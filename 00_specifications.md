## Incubator
The incubator is a housing for cell and tissue culture, which requires manual adjustment and automatic regulation of atmospheric conditions (temperature, CO2) without overshoot, ease of disinfection, aseptic use and alarm notifications. In addition, this prototype will provide wireless connectivity and control and have a transparent door for sample observation without opening. The prototype will be built from a modified thermoelectric wine-cooler.

## Tray
### Pumping system
The pumping system on each tray will be composed of two oscillating syringe pumps, which will exchange nutrient medium between two syringes through the culture dish. The pumping system will allow automatic regulation and manual adjustment of medium flow, as well as motor position using control buttons and a wi-fi connected web interface.

Build:	Aluminium
Charging:	Powered by incubator housing, battery, external power supply
Pump:	Syringe pump, stepper motor driven lead screw mechanism
Syringes:	2x20ml (Braun Omnifix with luer-lock)
Flow:	0.05 - 2ml/min ± 0.01ml/min
Tubing:	Cell culture silicone (biocompatible, autoclavable)
Tubing connections:	Luer-lock (polypropylene)
Dead volume:	<5ml
Monitoring/control:	Digital display, control buttons, Wi-fi with web interface
Control parameters:	Flow-rate, motor position
Sensors:	Motor limit switch, temperature

### Bubble trap ( = debubbler)
Two bubble traps/debubblers will be installed per tray in between the culture dish and each syringe pump to prevent possible air bubbles from entering the tissue samples during medium flow from either side. As a consequence, each membrane based unit will also allow gas exchange by diffusion.

Build:	Custom construction (PEEK)
Membrane:	PTFE, 0.2µm porosity
Maximum flow-rate:	2ml/min (both directions)
Tubing connection:	Luer-lock
Other features:	Autoclavable, leak-proof

### Tissue platform
The custom-made culture dish will be adapted for the perfusable New Harvest tissue samples and will fulfill the following functions: Allow simple inserting and exchange of samples, as well as attaching them to the perfusion system via catheter, while being leak-proof. The samples will be kept in place, however, the container will allow contractions of the sample. The housing will be autoclavable, suitable for reuse and allow assembly without additional tools. In addition, the cover will contain a glass window made from standard microscope slides to allow observation without disturbing the samples.

Build:	Custom construction (PEEK)
Sample container:	Holding sample in place while allowing contraction and extension in Y and Z directions.
Sample insert/exchange in 2 steps without additional tools.
Perfusion:	Leak-proof catheter (peripheral venous type) insert/fastening in 2 steps without additional tools, luer-lock connectivity.
Other features:	Autoclavable, transparent glass window (microscope slide)
Possible upgrades:	digital microscope for online monitoring
Requirements:	Precise, repeatable sample size
