## Perfusion system assembly <a id="perfusion"></a>

### Prepare components
 1. Bubble trap
    * trace the bubble trap frame onto the PTFE membrane (0.2μm pore-size)
	* cut the membrane and place on top of the pool
	* pierece holes using a sharp tool
	* place lid on top and screw both plastic parts together using M3 screws
	
 2. Tissue platform

 3. Fill syringes with culture medium
    * Carefully fill syringe A to the 20ml mark with medium through a PES syringe filter (0.2μm pore-size).
    * Repeat process with syringe B to fill to the 5ml mark.
   
### Sterilization
 - Place Bubble trap, tissue platform, tubing and connectors into a covered container and autoclave at 121°C for 20min.
 - Sterilize tray by spraying with 70% Ethanol and wiping with lint-free wipes. Alternatively, place under UV sterilization for 1 hour.
 
### Install components on specified locations
 - Move syringe piston holders to the 20ml and 5ml positions respectively.
 - Place Braun Omnifix 20ml syringes into the specified holders.
 - Place bubble traps and tissue platform into the specified positions to automatically attach using permanent magnets.
 - Connect silicone tubing to syringes, bubble traps, syringe filters and IV catheters.
 - Flush circulation half B to the tip of the catheter.
 - Connect and flush the tissue platform as shown in the video:
