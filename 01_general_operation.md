## General operation <a id="set-up"></a>

### Incubator
Initial set-up and general operation of the incubator are documented [HERE](https://github.com/symbiolab/NewHarvest-modular-bioreactor/blob/master/02_incubator-operation-instructions.pdf)

### Tray
Initial set-up and general operation of the tray are documented [HERE](https://github.com/symbiolab/NewHarvest-modular-bioreactor/blob/master/03_tray-operation-instructions.pdf)


 
## Perfusion system assembly <a id="perfusion"></a>

### Prepare components
 1. Bubble trap
    * trace the bubble trap frame onto the PTFE membrane (0.2μm pore-size)
	* cut the membrane and place on top of the pool
	* pierece holes using a sharp tool
	* place lid on top and screw both plastic parts together using M3 screws
	
 2. Tissue platform
Tissue platform assemby is performed as shown in the video.

 3. Fill syringes with culture medium
    * Carefully fill syringe A to the 20ml mark with medium through a PES syringe filter (0.2μm pore-size).
    * Repeat process with syringe B to fill to the 5ml mark.
   
### Sterilization
 - Place Bubble trap, tissue platform, tubing and connectors into a covered container and autoclave at 121°C for 20min.
 - Sterilize tray by spraying with 70% Ethanol and wiping with lint-free wipes. Alternatively, place under UV sterilization for 1 hour.
 
### Install components on specified locations <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
A schematic of an assembled tray is shown in the figure below:

 - Move syringe piston holders to the 20ml and 5ml positions respectively.
 - Place Braun Omnifix 20ml syringes into the specified holders.
 - Place bubble traps and tissue platform into the specified positions to automatically attach using permanent magnets.
 - Connect silicone tubing to syringes, bubble traps, syringe filters and IV catheters.
 - Flush circulation half B to the tip of the catheter.
 - Connect and flush the tissue platform as shown in the video:
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/RASLVN8P1gc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RASLVN8P1gc "New Harvest Modular Bioreactor - Tissue Platform Flushing")

 - Disconnect syringe A from the tubing and empty syringe B completely to flush the rest of the tubing.
 - Reconnect syringe A.


## Starting first cycle <a id="cycle"></a>
 - Install tray into the incubator
 - Set perfusion speed as described in the [tray operation instructions](https://github.com/symbiolab/NewHarvest-modular-bioreactor/blob/master/hardware/03_tray-operation-instructions.pdf)
 - Start cycle


#### Notes:
<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: This version of the perfusion system exhibits strong level changes in the bubble traps, which will be corrected in the next version of the circulation system (based on unidirectional perfusion).
